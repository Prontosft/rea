# Bun standalone executables

`inspect-artifact` inventories embedded Bun module graphs in Mach-O `__BUN,__bun`,
PE `.bun`, ELF `.bun`, and appended trailers. `extract-artifact` writes their stored
module contents through the existing safe output tree. Neither operation executes
the executable or decompiles bytecode.

```sh
rea inspect-artifact ./hello --json
rea extract-artifact ./hello --json
```

In MCP, open the executable with `open_binary`, then call `inspect_artifact`.
Use `detail: "summary"` for large graphs and `inspect_analysis_view` to page retained
Evidence. The existing artifact contracts and catalog expose Bun metadata without
adding a tool.

The root reports the carrier, layout, module count, entry point, raw flags and
compile exec-argv. Each module retains its source name, loader and encoding values,
entry-point status, sizes and SHA-256. Sourcemaps, bytecode and module-info regions
are separate children. Source names such as `/$bunfs/root/main.js` remain in
metadata; extraction uses a relative path. Unsafe or non-UTF-8 names receive an
indexed path and retain their source spelling or bytes. Duplicate names remain
separate occurrences; ordinary extraction collision rules apply.

The recognized record shapes are the 36-byte Bun 1.3.3 layout and the 52-byte
Bun 1.3.9 layout. These labels identify structural layouts, not a detected compiler
version. Bun does not store an explicit revision identifier: unknown table sizes
and ambiguous known layouts are unsupported. A future layout that is byte-for-byte
compatible cannot be distinguished. Invalid pointers and truncated claimed sections
are malformed. An absent trailer without a named section does not establish a Bun
graph. Unknown enum values remain raw, with a null name.

Sourcemaps are stored Bun regions, not necessarily standalone JSON source maps.
Extracted contents retain their original encoding. Use JavaScript analysis only on
compatible source files; bytecode is retained as evidence, not decoded.

See [limits and recovery](design/limits-and-recovery.md) for admission ceilings.
Synthetic tests cover the carriers and malformed declarations. Run
`node scripts/verify-bun-standalone.mjs` after `npm run build:cached` for local Bun
verification, and add `--docker` to compile a Linux fixture with `oven/bun:1.4.0`.
Bun and Docker are fixture producers only and are not installed by REA.
